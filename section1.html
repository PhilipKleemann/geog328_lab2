        <h1>Geography of Mount Rainier</h1>

        <p>
            Mount Rainier is located in the Cascade Range of Washington State, approximately 87 kilometers
            (54 miles) southeast of Seattle. Rising to 4,392 meters (14,411 feet), it is the tallest peak in the Pacific Northwest
            and one of the most prominent mountains in the contiguous United States, with a topographic prominence of 4,027 meters (13,211 feet).
            The mountain’s immense size and glacial coverage make it an iconic symbol of the region’s natural beauty and geological power.
        </p>

        <h2>Location and Setting</h2>
        <p>
            The mountain forms the centerpiece of <strong>Mount Rainier National Park</strong>, established in 1899 as the fifth national park in the U.S.
            It is situated within the central portion of the Cascade Range, surrounded by dense coniferous forests, subalpine meadows, and broad river valleys.
            The surrounding landscape transitions from lowland forests of Douglas fir and western hemlock to subalpine meadows filled with wildflowers in summer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mount Rainier’s vast presence dominates the skyline and can be seen from many parts of western Washington,
            including Tacoma, Seattle, and Olympia. The park covers over 956 square kilometers (236,000 acres),
            protecting not only the mountain itself but also an array of geological and ecological features shaped by its glacial and volcanic history.
        </p>

        <h2>Geological Features</h2>
        <p>
            Mount Rainier is a massive stratovolcano made mostly of andesite and basaltic lava flows.
            It has been built over several hundred thousand years through explosive eruptions. The mountain’s
            current cone is estimated to be less than 500,000 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
            The volcano sits above the <strong>Juan de Fuca–North American Plate subduction zone</strong>,
            where the smaller oceanic plate is forced beneath the continental crust.
            This tectonic activity generates the magma that feeds the Cascade volcanic arc, which includes Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, and Mount Hood.
            The summit area contains two overlapping volcanic craters, each roughly 300 meters (1,000 feet) in diameter,
            which are filled with snow and ice.
        </p>

        <h2>Glaciers and Drainage</h2>
        <p>
            Mount Rainier is home to the largest glacier system in the contiguous United States, with over 25 named glaciers
            covering approximately 90 square kilometers (35 square miles). Major glaciers include the Emmons, Carbon, Nisqually,
            and Tahoma Glaciers. The Emmons Glacier is the largest glacier by area in the U.S. outside Alaska.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ice melt from these glaciers feed several major rivers, including the Nisqually, Carbon, Puyallup,
            and White Rivers, which flow toward the Puget Sound and the Columbia River basin.
            These rivers play an essential role in maintaining western Washington’s water supply,
            supporting ecosystems and communities downstream.
        </p>

        <h2>Landforms and Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>
            The mountain’s steep slopes and elevation create distinct ecological zones.
            At lower elevations (below 1,200 meters), temperate rainforests thrive with species like western red cedar and bigleaf maple.
            Mid-elevations host subalpine forests of mountain hemlock and silver fir,
            while higher elevations transition into meadows filled with lupine, paintbrush, and avalanche lilies.
            Near the summit, vegetation disappears, replaced by bare rock, snowfields, and glacial ice.
        </p>
        <p>
            The park’s landforms include deep glacial valleys, ridges, moraines, lava ridges, and remnants of ancient landslides.
            One of the most notable is the <strong>Osceola Mudflow</strong>, a massive lahar that occurred about 5,600 years ago,
            traveling more than 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the volcano and reshaping the Puget Sound lowlands.
            These geological and ecological features make Mount Rainier a natural laboratory for studying
            volcanic activity, glaciation, and ecosystem adaptation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mount Rainier’s complex geography supports over 1,000 plant species and hundreds of animal species,
            including black bears, elk, marmots, and mountain goats. Its diverse habitats and dramatic landscapes
            continue to attract scientists, hikers, and nature enthusiasts from around the world.
