        <!-- Temperate Rainforest -->
        <div class="climate_box" data-bg="img/temperate_rainforest.webp">   
            <h3>Temperate Rainforest</h3>
            <p>
                At elevations below about 1,200 meters (4,000 feet), Mount Rainier is surrounded by
                a temperate rainforest climate. These lower areas can receive up to 250 centimeters (100 inches)
                of rainfall every year, mostly between October and May. Winters are cold and wet, while summers can get warm, however it's brief.
            </p>
            <p>
                The forests here are dominated by towering <strong>Douglas firs</strong>, <strong>western hemlocks</strong>,
                and <strong>western red cedars</strong>. Thick moss and ferns take up the forest,
                creating a damp, green environment that supports the diverse wildlife such as deer, black bears, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                This zone plays a crucial role in storing water, moderating runoff, and supporting the rich biodiversity
                of Mount Rainier National Park’s ecosystems.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Alpine Meadows -->
        <div class="climate_box" data-bg="img/meadows.jpg">
            <h3>Alpine Meadows</h3>
            <p>
                Above the forests, between roughly 1,200 and 2,100 meters (4,000–7,000 feet),
                Are the subalpine and alpine meadows. Here, snowfall replaces rainfall for the dominant form of precipitation,
                and snow build up can linger into early summer.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the short but beautiful summer season, meadows bloom with wildflowers such as the
                <strong>lupine</strong>, <strong>Indian paintbrush</strong>, and <strong>avalanche lilies</strong>.
                These meadows provide a critically important summer grazing habitat for elk, marmots, and mountain goats.
            </p>
            <p>
                Temperatures can fluctuate rapidly in this zone, warm sunshine can quickly turn into fog,
                rain, or even snow, making it one of the most dynamic climates on the mountain.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Glaciers -->
        <div class="climate_box" data-bg="img/glaciers.jpg">
            <h3>Glaciers</h3>
            <p>
                Near and above 2,100 meters (7,000 feet), the environment becomes permanently cold and icy.
                Mount Rainier is home to more than 25 named glaciers, including the <strong>Emmons</strong>,
                <strong>Carbon</strong>, <strong>Nisqually</strong>, and <strong>Tahoma</strong> Glaciers.
                This zone experiences below-freezing temperatures for much of the year, with strong winds and heavy snowfall.
            </p>
            <p>
                The upper mountain’s climate is classified as <strong>alpine or polar tundra</strong>,
                where vegetation is sparse or absent. Precipitation mostly falls as snow, which compacts into glacial ice
                over centuries. These glaciers act as natural reservoirs, releasing icemelt that feeds the region’s major rivers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The glaciers are also key indicators of climate change, many have been retreating over the last century,
                offering valuable insights into the effects of global warming in the Pacific Northwest.
